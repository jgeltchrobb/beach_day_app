Application Documentation: ‘the spot’

The Idea
The idea is an application which suggests the best location for an outdoor recreational activity, based on weather conditions. The user would choose the activity and receive a suggestion. 
Problem
You know what you feel like doing but you don’t know which location has the most suitable weather conditions, within a set distance radius.

Currently you would check the weather at each potential location and compute the decision yourself. Correct decision making requires time and a good understanding of how the weather impacts the quality of conditions for a given activity, and in many cases we do have such expertise. 

So, to make good decisions and enjoy your activities to fullest you would have to spend time developing the required expertise and computing decisions.

The creators of ‘the spot’ are not aware of any consumer product that explicitly addresses this problem.
Solution
Create an application that indicates the best locations for a chosen activity at a specific time, within a set area.

The user should choose from a list of supported activities and the application should output the best locations to perform that activity based on actual weather conditions.

Note: This preliminary solution aims merely to demonstrate the concept, offering a choice of only three activities (Surf, Kite Surf or Family Beach day) and using limited variables and primitive decision making processes to determine the optimum locations.
Design & Development
Approach
    • Define the input and outputs based on application purpose and user experience
    • Consider data requirements and research potential sources
    • Consider process/gem requirements and research potential ruby gems
    • Integrate with API’s, access required data, and test gems relevant functionality
    • Format data structures for simple referencing to code
    • Plan high-level code logic  
    • Begin writing code, testing regularly and finalizing through trial and error
Testing
    • Running the code required connecting to the weather API which took time and changed the data each time, so for testing we set up a dummy data set in the text editor – This really helped by speeding things up kept results consistent.
